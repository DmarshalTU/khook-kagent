# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The KAgent Hook Controller is a Kubernetes controller that enables automated responses to Kubernetes events by integrating with the Kagent platform. This controller will monitor multiple Kubernetes events per hook configuration and trigger different Kagent agents with contextual information when those events occur, providing intelligent automation and incident response capabilities within Kubernetes clusters.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to define hook objects that specify multiple Kubernetes events with their corresponding Kagent agents and prompts, so that I can automate different responses to various cluster incidents and operational events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hook object is created THEN the system SHALL validate that it contains a list of event configurations, each with event type, agent identifier, and prompt template
2. WHEN a hook object specifies event types THEN the system SHALL support pod restart, pod pending, OOM kill, and probe failed event types
3. WHEN a hook object is deployed THEN the controller SHALL begin monitoring for all specified event types
4. IF a hook object contains invalid event types THEN the system SHALL reject the object with appropriate error messages
5. WHEN an event configuration is defined THEN each event type SHALL have its own agent identifier and prompt template

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want the controller to listen for Kubernetes events matching deployed hook configurations, so that relevant events are captured and processed automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the controller starts THEN it SHALL discover all existing hook objects in the cluster
2. WHEN a new hook object is created THEN the controller SHALL automatically start monitoring for all its specified event types
3. WHEN a hook object is deleted THEN the controller SHALL stop monitoring for all its associated events
4. WHEN multiple hook objects monitor the same event type THEN the controller SHALL trigger all matching hooks with their respective agent and prompt configurations
### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the controller to call the appropriate Kagent agent with event context when monitored events occur, so that intelligent responses can be generated based on the specific incident details and event type.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a monitored event occurs THEN the controller SHALL identify the matching event configuration and call its specified Kagent agent via the Kagent API
2. WHEN calling the Kagent agent THEN the system SHALL pass event name, timestamp, involved Kubernetes resource name, and the event-specific configured prompt
3. WHEN the API call is made THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication and error handling
4. IF the Kagent API call fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and retry according to configured retry policy
5. WHEN the same hook monitors multiple event types THEN each event type SHALL trigger its own specific agent and prompt combination

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cluster operator, I want the controller to track event firing status and implement deduplication, so that I don't receive duplicate notifications for the same ongoing issue.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an event is processed THEN the controller SHALL record the event data in the hook status
2. WHEN an event is processed THEN the controller SHALL mark the event as "firing" in the hook status
3. WHEN the same event occurs within 10 minutes THEN the controller SHALL ignore the duplicate event
4. WHEN 10 minutes pass after an event THEN the controller SHALL clear the event from hook status and mark it as "resolved"
5. WHEN the same event occurs after the 10-minute timeout THEN the controller SHALL process it as a new event and fire the hook again

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Kubernetes administrator, I want the controller to provide observability and status reporting, so that I can monitor the health and activity of the hook system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN events are processed THEN the controller SHALL emit Kubernetes events for audit trails
2. WHEN hook objects are processed THEN the controller SHALL update their status with current state information
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the controller SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
4. WHEN the controller starts THEN it SHALL log initialization status and configuration details
